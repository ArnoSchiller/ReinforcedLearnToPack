## Concept
To build this project, the requirements are divided into different scenarios. To create a gymnasium environment, each scenario requires an `action_space`, an `observation_space`, and a reward strategy. With these definitions, a class inherited from the gymnasium environment can be created, which must override the `__init__`, `reset`, `step`, and `render` functions. 

### Scenario 1:
- 2D packing problem: a list of items are provided and the goal is to place as many items inside the bin as possible
-  `action_space`: 
   -  move_left
   -  move_right
   -  pack
- `observation_space`:
  - matrix of the bin representing the allocated and free space
  - current position of the item to pack
  - (list of remaining items to pack)
- `reward`:
  - for each correct placed item: +1 
  - for a wrong placement: -100 and game over
## ToDos
- [x] Setup the initial gymnasion environment 
- [X] Write the concept
- [X] Redefine the action space
- [ ] Redefine the observation space (grid + item)
- [ ] Update step with new actions and observations
- [ ] Update render function
- [ ] Combine env with RL
- [ ] Write test cases
